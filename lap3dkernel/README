Dense direct N-body performance tests.  Currently this has one
directory for each language implementation, with code for summing 1/r
from 1e4 sources to 1e4 targets, for double precision reals.  This is
my own version of David Stein's similar performance comparison on the
same task.

To run all tests in linux (assumes you have all packages and compilers):

  ./run_all_tests.sh


Results for i7-7700HQ (2017 laptop, 2.8GHz, 3.8GHz turbo, 4-core, 8-threads):

* fortran (GCC 7) + omp: 80 ms = 1.3 Gpair/sec
* julia w/ @threads @simd and writing out C-like code: 80 ms = 1.3 Gpair/sec
   native julia: 0.06 Gpair/sec
* python (Intel) w/ numba: 1.3 Gpair/sec, after jit compilation time of 3 sec.
   native py: 0.05 Gpair/sec
* MATLAB: 0.11 Gpair/sec, uses all 8 threads
* octave (w/ same code as MATLAB): 0.06 Gpair/sec, uses 1 thread
