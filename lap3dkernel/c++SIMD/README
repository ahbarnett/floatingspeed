This is edited from Libin Lu's SIMD demos of Dec 2019, here:

See that repo for more information about SIMD.

It was changed from 1D to 3D, and from exp kernel to plain 1/r.
Timing outputs were improved.

The directory VCL_AgnerFog_version1 is the vectorclass library from here:

To compile, see the cpp file.
